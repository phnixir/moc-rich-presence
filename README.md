# Discord rich presence for Music on Console
This is a small rust program using the moc-rs crate to add discord rich presence
functionality to the MoC server, I use MoC a LOT and I love it, I also enjoy
using discord and I couldn't find anything that would add rich presence
functionality to MoC, so I wrote it myself!

⚠️ This utility assumes that you have the program `mocp` in your path, since MoC
is a linux only program you can find an up to date version in most distribution's
repositories in a package called `moc`

For arch you would do:
```
sudo pacman -S moc
```

And for debian or ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install moc
```

Which would make the `mocp` program available in path, if you can't install it
have a look over at the official [moc download page](https://moc.daper.net/download).
